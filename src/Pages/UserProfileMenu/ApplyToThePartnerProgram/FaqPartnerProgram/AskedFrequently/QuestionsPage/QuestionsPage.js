            No, you don’t have to be a paying FreeMium member to join the
            Partner Program and start earning. If you do subscribe to be a
            member, your monthly membership fees will directly support writers
            on FreeMium.

            There are two ways to earn money with the Partner Program: Partner
            Program writers are paid monthly based on how much time FreeMium
            members spend reading their stories. The longer members read, the
            more writers earn. Every time you convert a reader to a paying
            member you get half of that reader’s membership fee, net of standard
            payment processor fees, for as long as they are an active member.

            Yes. Readers who aren’t yet members can access a select number of
            free stories per month, so your ideas still reach everyone on the
            internet. For unlimited stories, readers can upgrade to membership
            for $5/month. ‍ However, you’ll only earn money based on reading
            time when a subscribing member reads your story, or when a reader
            becomes a member within 30 days of reading your story.

            Here are some tools and tips to increase referrals: Referrals
            landing page: Every Partner Program writer has a personalized
            referral landing page where readers can become a paying member for
            unlimited access to their writing, plus everything else on FreeMium.
            Writers can promote their landing page on other platforms to try to
            drive more Referred Memberships. Email subscriptions: When a
            non-member subscribes to receive your stories via email (see details
            on email subscriptions here), they'll be asked if they want to
            become a member. If they convert via that prompt, that membership
            will count toward your referral earnings. You may promote your
            referral link in your posts. As a best practice, we recommend that
            the link is as unobtrusive as possible (stick it at the beginning or
            bottom of your story) and that you give the reader a sense of why
            they should support your work and what they can expect. If it’s not
            already explained in your message, you’ll also need to let your
            readers know that you’ll receive a portion of their membership fees.

            referrals.

            No. Promoting Referred Memberships is optional and in addition to
            earnings generated based on member read time. FreeMium writers who
            prefer to earn solely based on member reading time are more than
            welcome to do so.
